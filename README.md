# 🚀 Orbit
**Find people in your nearby orbit.**
Orbit is a social discovery app designed for college students — a place to connect with friends, join clubs, find study partners, and discover campus events. Think Tinder meets university life — swipe, match, and build meaningful student connections.

## 🌟 Inspiration

We noticed that even though universities are full of opportunities, it’s still hard to meet new people outside your usual circles. Orbit helps students expand their “orbit” by matching them with nearby peers based on shared interests, classes, or goals.
